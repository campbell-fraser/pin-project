This program randomly generates an episode of Ben Ashenden and Alex Owen's "The Pin", a radio sketch show.

Using audacity, I cut each episode into the individual sketches, categorised them, and numbered them arbitrarily so that Python could choose from a list of numbers and select the respective sketch to play.

My goal with this project is to have this program randomly pull from a complete pool of sketches to generate a unique episode of The Pin. I also want to include a graphical element eventually (which I've never done before with Python!) so I'm looking to learning that!

If Alex and Ben are reading this, I love your show and can't wait for series 5! ...so that I can cut it up and use the pieces for my own selfish project.
